# Exploratory Data Analysis and Linear Regression Model for Sale Price Prediction

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains various attributes related to properties listed in the Rolling Sales Files. Below are the details of each attribute:

- **Borough**: The name of the borough in which the property is located.
- **Neighborhood**: The common name of the neighborhood.
- **Building Class Category**: Indicates the broad usage category of the property (e.g., One Family Homes).
- **Tax Class at Present**: Assigns a property to one of four tax classes (Classes 1, 2, 3, and 4), based on its use.
- **Block**: A subdivision of the borough on which real properties are located.
- **Lot**: A subdivision of a Tax Block, representing the property's unique location.
- **Easement**: A right, such as a right of way, allowing limited use of another’s real property.
- **Building Class at Present**: Describes the property’s constructive use.
- **Address**: The street address of the property as listed on the Sales File.
- **Zip Code**: The property’s postal code.
- **Residential Units**: Number of residential units at the listed property.
- **Commercial Units**: Number of commercial units at the listed property.
- **Total Units**: Total number of units at the listed property.
- **Land Square Feet**: Land area of the property listed in square feet.
- **Gross Square Feet**: Total area of all the floors of a building measured from the exterior surfaces of the outside walls.
- **Year Built**: Year the structure on the property was built.
- **Building Class at Time of Sale**: Describes the property’s constructive use at the time of sale.
- **Sales Price**: Price paid for the property.
- **Sale Date**: Date the property sold.

## Analysis Approach

We will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and distributions. Following that, we will apply linear regression modeling to predict sale prices based on the available features.

Stay tuned for updates and insights derived from the analysis!
